<h1>Alfred Snippets to yml</h1>

🤔 Works on my machine™

⚠️ Untested, probably unreliable, most probably not safe to use ⚠️
</center>

## Guide

- Replace content of `src` folder with content of `snippets` folder from your Alfred preferences folder
- Run `index.js`
- Your snippets in condensed format is in `result.yml`

## Why

Extract Alfred snippets for use in my [setup repo](https://github.com/Strajk/setup)
